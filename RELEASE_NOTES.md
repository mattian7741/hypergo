### Release Notes - Version X.X.X

#### New Features
- Added a new command-line interface module: `hypergo/hypergo_cli.py`.
  - The `HypergoCli` class provides functionality for interacting with the hypergo system via the command line.
  - Includes commands such as `run`, `use`, `init`, `start`, and `graph` to perform various operations within the system.
- Introduced the `hypergo/hypergo_click.py` module.
  - This module contains a click-based command-line interface for the hypergo system.
  - New commands such as `shell`, `run`, `use`, `init`, `start`, and `graph` are available for easier interaction.

#### Bug Fixes
- Fixed an issue in the `hypergo/hypergo_cmd.py` module, where the `do_exit` method was not properly implemented. It now correctly exits the command-line interface.

#### Dependencies
- Added the following new dependencies in `setup.cfg`:
  - `click`: A Python package for creating command-line interfaces easily.
  - `ansicolors`: A package for adding colored output to the command-line interface.
  - `click-default-group`: A package for setting a default command in click-based command-line interfaces.
  - `graphviz`: A package for working with Graphviz graph visualization software.
  - `urllib3<2.0`: An updated version of urllib3 to address potential compatibility issues.

#### Miscellaneous
- Updated the `install_requires` section in `setup.py` to include the newly added dependencies.
